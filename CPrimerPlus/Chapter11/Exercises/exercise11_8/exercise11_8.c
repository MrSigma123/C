/*
  Write a function include_str(), which takes as arguments
  two string pointers. If second string is present inside first
  the function should return the address where that string is
  present. In example calling include_str("pula", "ul") should
  return the address of the letter u in the word "pula". If
  second string is not present inside the first one the return
  value should be NULL.
