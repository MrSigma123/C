1. Run one more time listing 4.1, but this time, when the program will ask
  about your name enter your name and your surname. What's happening and why?

  A: The program will take and store inside the string (char array) just the
     first name, the surname will be discarded, because after the whitespace
     character the program will insert '\0' character into the string.

2. Assuming, that everyone of the following code snippet is the part of complete program,
  what will be the effect of execution of any of them?

  a) printf("He sold the painting for %2.2f USD.\n", 2.345e2)
    the program will print the message completing the placeholder with 234.50

  b) printf("%c%c%c\n", 'H', 105, '\41');
    the program will print H, letter and ... something hah,
    just kidding, it'll print "Hi!" string

  c) #define Q "His Hamlet was funny, not being that vulgar."
    printf("%s\nconsists of %d characters.\n", Q, strlen(Q));
    the program will print the string defined in Q and will print it's length as well

  d) printf("Is %2.2e the same as %2.2f?\n", 1201.0, 1201.0);
    the program will print the string placing the same value in different form thanks
    to using different format specifiers, one is the exponent form and second it just
    the floating point value

3. Which changes you would put in question 2c, to display Q string in quotation marks?
  I would just add \" at the end and at the beginning of the string

4. It's time for looking for the errors!

  define P pech
  define X 10
  main(int)
  {
    int age;
    char name;

    printf("Enter your name.");
    scanf("%s", name);
    printf("It's allringht, %c, how old are you?", name);
    scanf("%f", age);
    xp = age + X;
    printf("What a %s! You have to have to be at least %d years old.\n", P, xp);
    return 0;
  }

  corrected way:

  #include <stdio.h>
  #define P "shame"
  #define X 10
  int main(void)
  {
    int age;
    int xp
    char name[20];
  
    printf("Enter your name.\n: ");
    scanf("%s", name);
    printf("It's all ringht, %s, how old are you?\n: ", name);
    scanf("%d", &age);
    xp = age + X;
    printf("What a %s! You have to have to be at least %d years old.\n", P, xp);
    return 0;
  }

5. Let's assume the beginning of the program looks like this:

  #define BOOK "War and peace"
  int main(void)
  {
    float price = 41.99;
    float procent = 80.0;
  }

  Form the pritnf() instruction, using constant BOOK and variable price and procent
  to print the following text:
  
  The wholesale price of this particular book "War and peace" is 41.99 USD.
  It's the 80% of the wholesale price.

  printf("The wholesale price of this particular book \"War and peace\" is %2.2f USD", price);
  printf("It's %2.1f of the wholesale price", procent);

6. Which format specifier you would use to print every of the following values?
  a) decimal integer value in field equal to it's numbers of digits: %d
  b) hexadecimal value in format 8A in the field width of 10 characters: %4X
  c) floating point value in 232.346 format with ยง10 field width: %10.3f
  d) floating point value in format 2.33e+002 in field of 12 characters format: %12.2e
  e) string placed to the left side of the line with the 30 characters field: %-30s

7. Which format specifier would you use to print any of the following values?
  a) integer of the unsigned long type of the width 15: (%15ld) or %15lu
  b) hexadecimal in the format 0x8a with the width of 4: %#4x
  c) floating point with the form of 2.33E+02 aligned to the left (width 12): %-12.2E
  d) floating point with the sign (+232.346) width the length 10: %+10.3f
  e) first 8 characters of string with the 8 char length: %8.8s

8. Which format specifier would you use to print any of the following values?
  a) integer with the length 4 in the length of the field of 6: %6.4d
  b) octal with the field of the length passed by the arguments: %*o
  c) char in the field length of 2: %2c
  d) floating point (+3.13) with the field of the length equal to the value: %+0.2f
  e) first 5 characters of the string aligned to the left edge (field l. 7): %-7.5s

9. For every following input strings format the scanf() function reading the value.
  Declare the variavles and arrays used in these instructions:
  a) 101
  int vlaue = 101;
  scanf("%d", &value);
  b) 22.32 and 8.34E-09
  float val1 = 22.32;
  float val2 = 8.23E-09;
  scanf(" %f %f", &val1, &val2)
  c) Chelsea
  char[20] string;
  scanf("%s", string);
  d) paragraph22
  char[15] string;
  int value;
  scanf("%s %d", string, &value);
  e) paragraph 22 (ommit the paragraph word)
  // not necessary char[15] strinng;
  int value;
  scanf("%* *d", &value);

10. What are not printable characters? (white space characters)?
  White space characters are the characters type, which are not printed on the sheet per se,
  they exist, but they are not visible, these are the tabulators, newline character or space
  character.

11. What is wrong with the following instruction? How to fix it?
  printf("The double type has %z bytes..\n", sizeof(double));
  A: To fix it we just need to change (correct) the format specifier to %zd
  (you could use also %zx to print the hex representation of the size value).
  %z is not a specifier, it's a modifier, so we have to change it to %zd

12. Let's assume that in your next programs you would like to use the parentheses
  instead of cur;y brackets. Is using the following directives the good solution?
  #define ( {
  #define ) }
  A: It's not a god solution. Probably it would be possible to make it, but it's not
  that worth of the effort. The program would realize the substitution, but all round
  brackets would be replaces, so the compiler won't recongnize which should be substituted
  and which should remain as the roud brackets
