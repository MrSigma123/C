1. How do we call all basic modules, of which the program written in C is constructed?
  - these are functions
2. What is a syntax error? Give one example on English and one in C language.
  - Syntax error is akin to the grammar error, whis is the usage of the language in
    inproper way, such as wrong word order or missing the functional characters
    like (. ? ! ; :). The syntax error is the act of breaking the language rules.
    * In English it would be "are ? What we doing"
    * In C programming language it would be "int int;"
      - which is using the reserved name as the variable nabe (forbidden)
3. What is an semantic error? Give one example in English and one in C language.
  - Semantic error is the error, which nature lies in it's meaning. It's the "proper"
    usage of the language in terms of grammar (syntaxly correct), but in incorrect way.
    * In English it would be "Are we bananas?"
    * In C programming language it would be "three_times_smaller -= 3;"
4. You have received the following program to accept it. Chack it's correctness,
  fix eventual errors.

  Original version:

  include stdio.h
  int main{void} /* program displays the number of the weeks in a year /*
  (
  int s

  s : = 56;
  print(In a year there are s weeks.\n);
  return 0;

  Corrected version:

  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(void) /* program displays the number of the weeks in a year */
  {
  int s;

  s = 52;
  printf("In a year there are %d weeks.\n", s);
  return 0;
  }

5. Let's assume that every of the segments below is the part of the complete program.
  What will be the effect of executing every single on of them?
  a) printf("The cat walked on to the fence and blinks");
    - printing the following text
  b) printf("It's a beautiful song, not too long.\n");
    - printing the text and going to the next line
  c) printf("Woman! Miserable fluff!\nYou windy creature!");
    - printing text, going to the next line, printing text
  d) printf("What?\nThere is/nno dinner?\n");
    - printing text with slash, and going to the next line
  e) int num;
     num = 2;
     printf("%d + %d = %d, num. num, num + num");

     RESULT:
     printing 2 + 2 = 4

6. What are the key words of the C programming language?
  main - keyword
  int - keyword
  function - not a keyword
  char - keyword
  = - not a keyword (operator)

7. In which way you would display the values of variables (words) and (lines)
  to produce the result like: There were 3020 words and 350 lines?
  The numbers 3020 and 350 are the variables values.

  RESULT:
  int words, lines;
  words = 3020;
  lines = 350;
  printf("There were %d words and %d lines", words, lines);

8. Analyze the following program:

  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(void)
  {
    int a, b;
    a = 5;
    b = 2;      /* line 7 */
    b = a;      /* line 8 */
    a = b;      /* line 9 */
    printf("%d %d\n", b, a);
    return 0;
  }

  What is the program state after executing line number 7?
  What is the program state after executing the line number 8 and
  then line number 9?

  After executing the line number 7 the program state is as below:
  a == 5, b == 2,
  after executing the line number 8 the program state is as below:
  a == 5, b == 5,
  after executing the line number 8 the program state is as below:
  a == 5, b == 5,

9. Analyze the following program:

  #include <stdio.h>
  int main(void)
  {
    int x, y;
    x = 10;
    y = 5;      /* line 7 */
    y = x + y;  /* line 8 */
    x = x * y;  /* line 9 */
    
    printf("%d %d\n", x, y);
  }

  What is the program state after executing the line number 7, 8 and 9?

  ANSWER:

  After executing the line number 7 the program state is:
  x == 10, y == 5

  after line 8:
  x == 10, y == 15;

  after line 9:
  x == 150, y == 15;
