/*
Write a program which initialize two-dimensional array which size is 3*5 and
which stores the double type elements and uses the VLA function to copy the
data into another two-dimensional array. Write also another VLA using function
which allows for displaying the content of the both arrays. The functions
should operate on N*M arrays. (If your compiler doesn't allow for VLA arrays
use instead traditional C programming ways and do the exercise for N*5 array).
