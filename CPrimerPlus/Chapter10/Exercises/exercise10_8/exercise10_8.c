/*
Use the copying function from exercise10_2 to copy the following elements
from an array. Copy the elements from the third to the fifth element of
an array that has 7 elements. The elements should be placed into another
three-element array. The function itself doesn't need to be modified;
what's necessary is choosing the right function arguments. (The arguments
don't have to be the array name and its sizeâ€”it's equally correct to pass
the address of a specific element and the number of elements to be copied).
