/*
Write a program that asks the user about entering three sets which consists of
the five double type values and then:
a) Writes those data into 3*5 sized array
b) Calculates the average for the whole separate set
c) Calculates the average for all the values
d) Finds the greates value from those 15 values
e) Displays the results

Each of the tasks should be executed by the separate function which use
the standard C programming arrays approach. Complete the task b) by using
the function which calculate and returs the average of the one-dimensional
array. Use the loop to call it three times. The other tasks should take as
argument the whole array and the exercises c) and d) should return the result
to its calling program. You don't have to worry about verifying the input from
the user - assume that the user won't make any mistakes while entering the
data.
