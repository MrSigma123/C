/* Write a program which reads the characters from stdin stream untill
  EOF is detected. For each character the program should inform if that
  certain character is a letter. If that character is a letter than the
  program should display the number of this letter in the latin alphabet.
  In example for the letter c and C both of these letters have the number
  3. Use a function which takes the caracter as an argument and returns
  the number of it's order in latin alphabet if it's the letter. In other
  case the function should return -1. */
