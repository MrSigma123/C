/* Generalize the function to_binary() from listing 9.8 to the to_base_n()
  which should take as the second argument the value from the rage (2 - 10).
  Then that function should display the number taken as the first argument
  which is corresponding to the second argument represented in other number
  system. In example the function to_base_n(129, 8) should display 201 which
  is the octal representation of 129 in decimal system. Check if that function
  works correctly by writing simple program which uses that function. */
