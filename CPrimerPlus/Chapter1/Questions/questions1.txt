1. What is portability in the programming concept?
  - Portability means, that the source code can be runned
    without greater issue on many different operating systems

2. Explain the difference between the source code fille,
  object code file and the executable file.
  - * The source code file is the file, in which programmer is
    typing the code in particular programming language
    * The object code is the file, which contains the source code file
    translated to the machine language, it's not ready to be run yet
    * The executable file is the type of the file, which is able
    to be runned, it's the object file linked with the library files and
    the startup files specific to the particular platform

3.  Name main 7 programming steps:
  - 1. Defining the program goals
    2. Designing the program
    3. Writing the code
    4. Compiling
    5. Running
    6. Debugging and testing
    7. Mantaining and developing

4. What is compiler?
  - The compiler is an program, which translates the source code into
  the machine language, which is understandable by the computer

5. What is a linker?
  - The linker is the program, which combines all the necessary program
  components, which are necessary to be linked in order to run the program
  as the executable file
